### **_Description_**

This application will allow you to keep track of all your finances. You will be able to add an account(Checking, Savings, Credit Cards, and Loans). After you add that account you will be able to add transactions that occurred in that account. On the home page you will see all accounts and balances to each account.

The application will be created with PERN (PostgresSQL, Express, React, Node.js) Stack. It will also be styled with Bootstrap using a template from bootswatch.com.
